A JFlex+Cup implementation for the CM language.

  Note that you need to modify the classpath in the Makefile so that it
will point to the directory where "java_cup" is located.  In my own setting,
classpath is /usr/share/java/cup.jar.

  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory

  To test source code like "fac.cm", type

    "java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main fac.cm"

and the syntax tree will be displayed on the screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

  Also note that all the abstract syntax tree structures are defined under
the directory "absyn" and within "Absyn.java" class, the showTree function
is implemented.  In addition, since some java files are generated automatically,
they may contain variables that are not used, which are safe to ignore in
the compilation process.
